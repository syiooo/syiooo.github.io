# Review of Linear Algebra

> This note is an introduction to **Linear Algebra** for future study. 

## 1. Overview

As you can see, I was studying GAMES 101 just for fun. It was relaxing at the beginning until I met the Lecture 03 -- Transformation... So, I went back to review and organize what I have learned for moving on.

You can see I was noting with English even though I am completely Chinese, hh... Simply because the lecture is in English for the whole time, and I was immersing in this Environment and found it interesting.

The second reason is that I want to attempt a new way to manage my note and practice my English writing in the same time. I will use DeepSeek or other AI to correct it, so you will see some non-typical expression in my post.

I think noting in this way is too slow, I will not do this again...
